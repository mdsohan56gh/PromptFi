# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is PromptFi?

PromptFi is a Web3 protocol that allows creators to mint their AI prompts as NFTs, track usage, and earn royalties when others use them.

### How does it work?

1. Creators write AI prompts and mint them as ERC-1155 NFTs
2. Prompt metadata is stored on IPFS/Arweave
3. When someone uses a prompt, usage is recorded on-chain
4. Revenue is automatically split between creator, platform, and treasury
5. Creators can withdraw earnings anytime

### What blockchains are supported?

Currently:
- Ethereum (mainnet and testnets)
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Optimism

### Do I need cryptocurrency to use PromptFi?

Yes, you need:
- ETH or MATIC for gas fees
- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Funds to purchase prompt access (for users)

## For Creators

### How do I create a prompt NFT?

1. Connect your wallet
2. Register as a creator
3. Fill out the prompt form
4. Upload to IPFS
5. Pay gas fee to mint
6. Your NFT is created!

### What royalty percentage should I set?

We recommend 10-20%. Higher royalties may discourage usage, while lower royalties mean less revenue per use.

### Can I update my prompt after minting?

No, once minted, the prompt content is immutable. This ensures copyright protection and authenticity.

### How do I withdraw earnings?

1. Go to Dashboard
2. Check your available earnings
3. Click "Withdraw"
4. Confirm transaction
5. Funds sent to your wallet

### What if my prompt gets no usage?

- Lower your royalty ratio
- Promote on social media

## For Users

### Can I get a refund?

### Can I resell prompt access?

Not currently, but marketplace features are planned for future releases.
